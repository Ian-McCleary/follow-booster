## About
<p>
This is an Instagram follow boosting web app which connects users who want to increase their follower count. The idea is that a user can use two accounts to follow
and recieve followers. Two users are then connected through the application, and exchange follows in a follow for follow trade. Users can also see insights into their
follower growth and chat with other users on the site.

## Reason for public

<p>
There are 3 reasons I decided to make this repository public. First, It relied on web scraping an Instagram viewer which is no longer online. I was unable
to gain access to the Instagram API so this was the unfortunate workaround. Second, It had a few backend security issues which I didnt have time to address.
Lastly, Id like to prove to employers that I have experience in AngularJS.
